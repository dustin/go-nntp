# go nntp

I needed a way to gate some web services into traditional readers.  I
wrote an NNTP client and server.

I'm still working on coming up with the exact right interfaces, but
take a look at [the couchserver][couchserver] example to see what it
takes to build a custom NNTP server with your own backend.
